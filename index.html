            director. It was a huge success and was the second-highest-grossing
            film in 1921. Now considered one of the greatest films of the silent
            era, it was selected for preservation in the United States National
            Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 2011.

            A King in New York is a 1957 British comedy film directed by and

            a satirical view of certain aspects of American politics and
            society. It was produced in Europe after Chaplin&#39;s exile from
            the U.S. in 1952 and did not open in the United States until

            condemnation of the German and Italian dictators Adolf Hitler and
            Benito Mussolini, as well as fascism, antisemitism, and the Nazis.
            At the time of its first release, the United States was still at
            peace with Nazi Germany and neutral during what were the early days
            of World War II. Chaplin plays both leading roles: a ruthless
            fascist dictator and a persecuted Jewish barber.<br />The Great
            Dictator was popular with audiences, becoming Chaplin&#39;s most
            commercially successful film.[4] Modern critics have praised it as a
            historically significant film, one of the greatest comedy films ever
            made and an important work of satire. In 1997, it was selected by
            the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States
            National Film Registry as being &#34;culturally, historically, or
            aesthetically significant&#34;.[5][6] The Great Dictator was
            nominated for five Academy Awards – Outstanding Production, Best
            Actor, Best Writing (Original Screenplay), Best Supporting Actor for
            Jack Oakie, and Best Music (Original Score).

            Limelight is a 1952 American comedy-drama film written, produced,
            directed by, and starring Charlie Chaplin, based on a novella by
            Chaplin titled Footlights.[2] The score was composed by Chaplin and
            arranged by Ray Rasch.
          </p>
          <p class="the-film-stars">
            The film stars Chaplin as a washed-up comedian who saves a suicidal
            dancer, played by Claire Bloom, from killing herself, and both try
            to get through life. Additional roles are provided by Nigel Bruce,
            Sydney Earl Chaplin, Wheeler Dryden, and Norman Lloyd, with an
            appearance from Buster Keaton. In dance scenes, Bloom is doubled by
            Melissa Hayden.Upon the film&#39;s release, critics&#39; reception
            was divided; it was heavily boycotted in the United States because
            of Chaplin&#39;s alleged communist sympathies, and failed
            commercially.
          </p>
          <p class="however-the-film-was">
            However, the film was re-released in the United States in 1972,
            which included its first screening in Los Angeles. This allowed the
            two-decades-old film to be in contention for the 45th Academy Awards
            where Chaplin won his only competitive Oscar. Today, the film is
            sometimes regarded as one of Chaplin&#39;s best and most personal
            works, and has attained a cult following.
          </p>
          <p class="the-production-of">
            The production of the film was the most difficult experience in
            Chaplin&#39;s career. Numerous problems and delays occurred,
            including a studio fire, the death of Chaplin&#39;s mother, as well
            as Chaplin&#39;s bitter divorce from his second wife Lita Grey, and
            the Internal Revenue Service&#39;s claims of Chaplin&#39;s owing
            back taxes, all of which culminated in filming being stalled for
            eight months.[2] The Circus was the seventh-highest grossing silent
            film in cinema history taking in more than $3.8 million in 1928.[1]
            The film continues to receive high praise. The film&#39;s copyright
            was renewed, so it entered the public domain on January 1, 2024.
